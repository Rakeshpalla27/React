I built Eat-n-Split, a simple React app that helps groups of friends split bills easily.
The app lets users add friends, enter expenses, and automatically calculate how much each person owes.
When someone pays, the total is fairly divided, and the app keeps track of who still needs to contribute. 
I used React hooks like useState to manage state and implemented conditional rendering to display balances dynamically.
The UI is clean and interactive, making it easy to track shared expenses. 
This project was a great way to practice handling dynamic data and improving my React skills.
